# Purpose: Developing a CI pipeline solution for re-rendering a repository's image files, based on specifications in the galleryze.yaml

# Ideally.. any commit to a galleryze file or a defined image file will:
  Run check - are the valid new entries in the .yaml?
  Run re-rendering - as per the .yaml
